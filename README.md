# Credit_Risk_Modeling

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of loan applicants defaulting, enabling financial institutions to make informed lending decisions and mitigate risks. The goal is to classify applicants into low-risk and high-risk categories using various machine learning models.

# Key Features:
Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature scaling.
Feature Engineering: Created new features to enhance model accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Used metrics such as AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model parameters to achieve better performance.
Cross-Validation: Ensured models generalize well by avoiding overfitting.
Visualization: Analyzed feature importance and evaluated model results using plots.
Outcome: Provided a reliable framework for identifying credit risks to reduce loan defaults.
Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
